Twitter Boggle (SI 507 HW5 Extra Credit 1)

Extra Credit 1 (2 pts) Twitter Boggle: Take two twitter accounts and analyze their tweets to find words they have in common and words that are unique to each account. Show the 5 most frequent different (unique) words for each account and the 5 most frequent common words (shared by both).

Running twitter_boggle.py will prompt the user for two twitter accounts to compare and the number of tweets in each's history to check. It will also cache data in a file called "boggle_twitter_cache.json".
